title: "Aerial flight paths for communication: How participants perceive and intend to respond to drone movements"
excerpt: 'This work has developed an iteratively refined understanding of participants' natural perceptions and responses to unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flight paths, or gestures. This includes both what they believe the UAV is trying to communicate to them, in addition to how they expect to respond through physical action.'
